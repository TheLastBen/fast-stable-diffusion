ImageGeneration during Training qul Ui update

Planned Emphasis on 1.5 training i do not plan to remove 2.x but i may end up having ddefault settings that do not play well with 2.x, options will always be made available to change these, the Goal of this colab is to be simple but give the User a wide Variety of options that are not currently easily accessible.

save logs to gdrive combine unet and text encoder training if wanted

Last bit of credit im going to give is to victorchall and his every EveryDream-Trainer Project he has been extremly helpful in learining about how these programs work EveryDream is not dreambooth, but i do recomend giving it a try for HUGE data sets or professional projects!
